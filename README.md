# LaLigaPredictor

**version v1.0.0-beta**

As of now, all data is in _data.csv_. Predict _N_ matches, and train with all previous entries in databse

Main program, _LaLigaPredictor.py_ processes, cleans data and use a MLP classifier to decide outcome of unknown matches. The classifier is run several times to try different initial random-states, so one ends up with a probability for each outcome (1, X, 2). If the probability of an outcome is larger than a threshold confidence value, the result is accepted.

The goal is to offer the user a way to systematically predict the outcome of future matches. In betting sites such as https://sports.bwin.com/en/sports/football-4, a user could, under their own responsibility, place bets following the predicted results. For last eight rounds in season 2019/20, we achieve a betting accuracy of 50.7 % (note that the results distribution for 2015-2020 is: 1:46.9%, X:25.3%, 2: 27.8%). An accuracy greater than 50 % means that one would always earn some amount of money for 1X2 betting ratios equal or greater than 1.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following packages are used:
- re
- numpy
- pandas
- statistics
- sklearn

### Usage

One can select which matches will be predicted by tuning the variables 'ignore_last_matches' and 'predict_matches'. The program will try to predict the outcome of the last 'predict_matches' entries in _data.csv_, after ignoring the last 'ignore_last_matches' entries. One would need to edit customizable parameters in header of _LaLigaPredictor.py_ and adapt the database _data.csv_, if necessary. Then, go to the main _LaLigaPredictor_ directory and simply tun _LaLigaPredictor.py_:

```
python LaLigaPredictor.py
```

## Database

### Basic database

I gathered data from different sources to get two initial databases:

**Laliga database**. It contains general information about previous matches. Originally from https://www.laliga.com/, although info has been compiled in Wikipedia already (e.g. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n_de_Espa%C3%B1a_2018-19), from where I have extracted it. It includes: Season, Round, TeamHome, Result, TeamAway, Stadium, Date, Time, Referee (only for 2016-2020), Spectators (only for 2016-2020), YellowCards (only for 2016-2020), RedCards (only for 2016-2020).

**Sofifa database**. It contains information about previous matches (but not match time), and players for each match. This info is generated by a crawler that takes basic match information and players from: https://www.bdfutbol.com. I scrapped overall ratings and potentials of players from https://sofifa.com, which contains info about FIFA games. It includes: Season, Round, TeamHome, Result, TeamAway, Stadium, Date, Referee, PlayersRating, PlayersPotential.

Then, I combined these two databases:

**Basic database**. It contains information of all matches and players from 2015 to 2019: **Season, Round, Time, TeamHome, Result, TeamAway, Referee, PlayersHome, PlayersAway, RatingHome, RatingAway, PotentialHome, PotentialAway**

### Expanded database

We used the information in the basic database to create new descriptors that would help improve the MLP accuracy. The descriptors used so far include:
- Season								      _(season year)_
- Round 								      _(season round)_
- Time 								        _(time when match started)_
- Result 							        _(final result of match)_
- AverageRatingAway 				  _(average player rating of TeamAway)_
- AverageRatingDifference 		_(difference of average player rating between the two teams)_
- AveragePotentialAway 			  _(average player potential of TeamAway)_
- AveragePotentialDiff 			  _(difference of average player potential between the two teams)_
- TeamHomeRecentPointsHome 	  _(points obtained by TeamHome in last 5 matches played home)_
- TeamAwayRecentPointsAway 	  _(points obtained by TeamAway in last 5 matches played away)_
- TeamHomeRecentPoints 			  _(points obtained by TeamHome in last 5 matches)_
- TeamAwayRecentPoints 		  	_(points obtained by TeamAway in last 5 matches)_
- TeamHomeRecentTiedMatches 	_(number of matches tied in last 5 matches played by TeamHome)_
- TeamAwayRecentTiedMatches 	_(number of matches tied in last 5 matches played by TeamAway)_
- TeamHomeRecentGoalsScored 	_(number of goals scored by TeamHome in last 5 matches)_
- TeamAwayRecentGoalsScored 	_(number of goals scored by TeamAway in last 5 matches)_
- TeamHomeRecentPointsh2h 		_(number of points obtained by TeamHome in last two matches against TeamAway)_
- TeamAwayCurrentTotalPoints 	_(total points obtained at this points of the season by TeamAway)_
- CurrentTotalPointsDiff 		  _(difference of total points obtained at this points of the season by TeamHome and TeamAway)_

## Development

The program is still under development. Main features that will be added soon:
- Inclue older matches
- Include descriptors that help MLP accuracy
- Consider 1X2 betting ratios to advise user how risky bet would be: this will help increase long term gain
